First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Description: The process that arrives first gets executed first. It's a simple and straightforward approach.

Characteristics:
Non-preemptive
Processes are executed in the order of their arrival.
Can lead to the "convoy effect" where shorter processes have to wait for longer ones.
