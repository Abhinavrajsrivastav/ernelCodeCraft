Conditions for deadlock - 
1. Mutual Exclution - Only one process can access the resource at a time.
2. Hold and Wait - A process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource.
3. No Preemption - Resources cannot be preempted from a process.
4. Circular Wait - A set of processes are waiting for each other in a circular chain.


Deadlock Prevention Techniques:

1. RAG(Resource Allocation Graph) - 
    - A cycle in the graph indicates a deadlock.

2. Banker's Algorithm - 
    - It is used to avoid deadlock.
    - It checks if the system is in a safe state or not.
    - If the system is in a safe state, then the request is granted.
    - If the system is not in a safe state, then the request is denied.
