Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-preemptive
Description: The process with the shortest burst time is selected for execution first. 
If two processes have the same burst time, FCFS is used as a tie-breaker.
Once a process starts executing, it runs until it completes (non-preemptive). 

Characteristics:
Non-preemptive
It minimizes the average waiting time but requires prior knowledge of the burst times of all processes.
