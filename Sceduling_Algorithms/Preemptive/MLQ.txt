Multilevel Queue Scheduling (Preemptive)

Description: Processes are divided into different queues based on priority.
The scheduler first selects a queue with the highest priority and executes processes
from that queue. Processes in lower-priority queues can be preempted if a higher-priority process arrives.

Characteristics:
Preemptive
Each queue can have different scheduling algorithms (FCFS, RR, etc.)
and processes can move between queues.Multilevel Queue Scheduling (Preemptive)
