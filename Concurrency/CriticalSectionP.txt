Critical Section Problem(Race Condition) -
One Resource, Many processes need to use this resource, 
but only one can use it at a time to avoid conflict.

Critical Section Problem Solutions

1. Locks.
2. Semaphores(Process synchronization) - (Binary(0 and 1) and 'Counting Semaphores[a,b] - when multiple instance of resource is available').
3. Atomic operation: The instruction reads and writes to memory in one uninterruptible step.

Solution Of CS Problem must have 3 conditions -

1. Mutual Exclusion - Only one thread can access the shared resource at a time.
2. Progress - any thread can try to get access of shared resource.
