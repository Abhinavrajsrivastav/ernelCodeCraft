Round Robin (RR)
Description: Each process is assigned a fixed time slice or "quantum." 
After a process uses its quantum, it is preempted, and the next process in the queue is executed.
This continues in a cyclic order.


Characteristics:
Preemptive
Fairly distributes CPU time across all processes.
Suitable for time-sharing systems but can have high context switching overhead if the time quantum is too small.
